Leading technical teams on a large-scale transformational program, modernising critical government registry systems to cloud-native architecture.

### Technical Leadership

As Team Lead, I manage a development team while continuing as a senior developer and subject matter expert. My responsibilities span architecture and design discussions, work estimation and planning, and conducting advanced training for developers.

I define best practices and provide technical guidance across 5 agile development teams, ensuring consistency and quality across the program. This includes code review standards, testing strategies, and architectural patterns.

### Cloud Infrastructure & DevOps

The project runs on modern cloud infrastructure requiring deep expertise in AWS, OpenShift, and Kubernetes. I work closely with DevSecOps teams to prepare and maintain environments for development, testing, and production.

Production support is a significant part of my role, involving incident investigation, forensics, and environment management for mission-critical systems that government organisations depend on daily.

### Systems Integration

I coordinate with teams building external systems integration, ensuring seamless interaction between our products and various government and third-party systems. This requires understanding the entire product ecosystem and how different components communicate.

### Developer Experience

A key focus has been improving the developer experience within the project. This includes removing roadblocks in test automation processes, refining CI/CD pipelines, and ensuring developers can work efficiently across the complex system landscape.

### Technologies Deep Dive

The technology stack centres on Spring and Java for backend services, with MongoDB providing flexible document storage and Elasticsearch powering search capabilities. RabbitMQ handles asynchronous messaging between services. The entire platform is containerised with Docker and orchestrated through Kubernetes on OpenShift, deployed to AWS infrastructure.
