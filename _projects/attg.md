A companion site for the television series featuring a fully interactive timeline of the past 4567 million years in the
Australian landscape. 

### Client Brief - Problem

During the research for a documentary series Essential Media gathered a large amount of information that couldn't be 
included in the TV episodes. Hoodlum was commissioned to build and interactive website to complement the series and 
make this extra information available.

### Action Taken

The site was initially planned as a series of panoramic landscapes with clickable hotspots to view the information. 
After starting the project I realised it wouldn’t be possible to display all the information they wanted with the 
suggested system. Through of series a rapid prototype developments I created the timeline navigation to place the 
information along, while still keeping the panoramic landscapes as per the original brief (minus awkward hotspots).

### Project Result

The clients were very happy with the final outcome of this project and, despite the show not currently airing, it still 
receives traffic on a daily basis. I am particularly proud of being able to find a logical and usable organisation of 
the data while maintaining the aesthetic goals of the project.
