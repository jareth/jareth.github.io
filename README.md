Jekyll + Tailwind setup is mostly based on [this blog post by Frank de Jonge][1] and the [example jekyll setup from Tailwindcss][2].

## Technology Stack

- **Jekyll** - Static site generator (GitHub Pages compatible)
- **Tailwind CSS** (v3.4.1) - Utility-first CSS framework
- **Webpack** (v5.90.3) - Asset bundler
- **PostCSS** - CSS processing with autoprefixer, cssnano, and PurgeCSS

## Local Development

Requires Ruby and Yarn. Setup tools:

    bundle install
    yarn install

For local development you can run both webpack watch and jekyll serve:

    yarn run watch & bundle exec jekyll serve && fg

Site will be available at `http://localhost:4000`

## Production Build

For production we use PurgeCSS to remove unused CSS rules, but this requires the final HTML to be present in Jekyll's build folder (`_site`). So first build Jekyll in production mode:

    JEKYLL_ENV=production bundle exec jekyll build

Then build Webpack in production mode:

    yarn run prod

### npm Scripts

- `yarn run prod` - Production build with PurgeCSS and minification
- `yarn run dev` - Development build
- `yarn run watch` - Development build with file watching

## Content Management

### Adding a Project

Create a markdown file in `_projects/` with front matter:

```yaml
---
short_name: myproject
name: My Project Name
client: Client Name
preview: https://assets.vanbone.com/images/myproject_proj.jpg
---

Project description and content goes here...
```

### Adding a Blog Post

Create a file in `_posts/` named `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md`:

```yaml
---
title: My Post Title
layout: post
---

Post content goes here...
```

Note: The blog section exists but is currently not linked in the navigation.

### Editing Navigation

Update `_data/navigation.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Home
  link: /
- name: About
  link: /about.html
- name: Projects
  link: /projects.html
```

## Styling

### Tailwind Configuration

- Custom font: Quicksand (configured in `tailwind.config.js`)
- Primary brand color: `bg-teal-300`
- Content scanning: `./_site/**/*.{html,js}`

### Custom CSS

Add custom styles to `assets/css/site.css` after the Tailwind directives:

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

/* Custom styles here */
```

## Asset Pipeline

Webpack compiles CSS and generates hashed filenames for cache busting. The manifest at `_data/manifest.yml` is auto-generated and used by Jekyll layouts:

```liquid
<link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ site.data.manifest['main.css'] }}">
```

### External Assets

Images and videos are hosted externally at `https://assets.vanbone.com/` to keep the repository lightweight.

Use the `video.html` include for responsive video embeds:

```liquid
{% include video.html
    width=800 height=400
    poster="https://assets.vanbone.com/images/example.jpg"
    mp4="https://assets.vanbone.com/videos/example.mp4"
    webm="https://assets.vanbone.com/videos/example.webm"
%}
```

## Deployment

1. Make changes to source files
2. Run production build (Jekyll first, then Webpack)
3. Commit changes including the `dist/` folder
4. Push to repository
5. GitHub Pages automatically rebuilds and deploys

**Important:** The `dist/` folder must be committed. The `_site/` folder is gitignored and regenerated by GitHub Pages.

## Updating Dependencies

```bash
bundle update        # Update Ruby gems
yarn upgrade         # Update Node packages
```

Test after updates, especially the `github-pages` gem which may have specific version requirements.
