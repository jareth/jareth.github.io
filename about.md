About Me
-----------------------

I'm a software developer with degrees in software engineering and graphic design. 
I have spent the majority of my career developing in Actionscript, and more recently JavaScript. 

I am also comfortable stepping outside the developer role and at various times I have performed:
 - project management
 - creative direction
 - technical consulting
 - design
 - animation
 - systems administration
 - experience design
 - client management
 - team lead
 
I'm never afraid to get my hands dirty or try something I've never done before.
I would describe myself as creatively logical. 
I love trying to find the best way to approach a problem or optimise a process, 
but I know that doesn’t mean everything has to be done the same boring way. 
Most people would describe me as helpful - 
I’m always willing to do that little bit extra if it makes someone else's job easier.
