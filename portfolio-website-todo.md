## Content Alignment Checklist

Ensure the following themes from LinkedIn are reflected on the website:

- [ ] Team leadership experience (not just individual contributor)
- [ ] Modern cloud technologies (AWS, Kubernetes, OpenShift)
- [ ] Large-scale enterprise/government projects
- [ ] Production support and system reliability
- [ ] Full-stack capabilities (not just frontend or backend)
- [ ] Cross-functional team collaboration
- [ ] Continuous improvement and best practices focus

## Notes

- The current site reads like it's from your 2018-2020 freelance period
- Need to bridge 5+ year gap in content freshness
- LinkedIn shows enterprise team leader; website shows freelance consultant
- Both can be true, but positioning needs to be clearer
- Consider whether freelance work is still something you want to promote
- If not actively freelancing, pivot messaging entirely to team leadership and enterprise development
